# YouTube-Video-Downloader
This repo contains a high-performance YouTube video downloader built with Node.js and Express, featuring a clean, responsive frontend built with vanilla JavaScript. It uses youtube-dl-exec for quick video processing, integrates server-side caching to keep things efficient, and relies on Firebase for analytics.

## Core Architecture

The application uses a multi-stage processing pipeline to handle video downloads efficiently

### Video Processing
The backend implements a dual-stream approach, separately processing video and audio streams for optimal quality. Using youtube-dl-exec, it fetches the highest quality streams available, then uses FFmpeg for combining them with optimized settings:

- Concurrent video/audio stream processing
- Smart buffer management (32MB buffer size)
- Ultrafast FFmpeg preset with threading optimization
- Automatic temporary file cleanup
- Chunked transfer encoding for smooth downloads

### Server Infrastructure
The Web App is currently hosted on my VPS with
- Nginx reverse proxy configuration
- Memory-optimized video processing
- Automatic cleanup routines

## Tech Stack
- Html and Css
- Vanilla JavaScript 
- Node.js & Express
- youtube-dl-exec for video processing
- FFmpeg for media handling
- Firebase integration

## Development Status 

This project is currently in its startup phase. The application is running smoothly in production **[here](https://youtube.sk10codebase.online)**, serving users with fast and reliable downloads. As I continue to grow this platform, I will be releasing versions of the source code in the future.
